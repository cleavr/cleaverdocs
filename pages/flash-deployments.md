## In one-fell-swoop
With Flash Deploy, tell Cleavr what you want to deploy and where to. Cleavr then takes over and - 
- Provisions a new server on your selected cloud hosting provider
- Installs all necessary dependencies according to the web app type
- Collects project code from your repository
- Builds and deploys your app 🚀

## Tell Cleavr about your app

In just a few steps, Cleavr will be working hard for you, freeing up your time for other things. ☕️
