[Loopback](https://loopback.io) is a highly-extensible, open-source Node.js framework that enables you to create dynamic end-to-end REST APIs with little or no coding.


## Prerequisite

### Install Loopback on server
When building your app in production, depending on how you have your build script setup in `package.json`, you may need to install Loopback's CLI on your 
server. If so, SSH into your server and run the following: 

```bashscript
npm i -g @loopback/cli
```

## Add a NodeJS SSR site

On an existing server, click **Add Site** to add a new site to your server. 

Select the **NodeJS SSR** option and enter the remainder site details and click **Add** to create the new site on your server. 

Cleavr will automatically install NodeJS on your server if NodeJS has not already been installed.  

## Add a Web App

After the site has successfully installed, you'll now need to create a web app and deploy out your application. 

In the web app section, you'll notice that a new web app was automatically created after the NodeJS site was added. This is a basic web app shell
that you can use to complete the setup of your web app. Click on **Complete Setup** on the web app. 

Configure the **VC Provider**, **Repository**, and **Branch To Deploy** fields on the Settings > Code Repository tab and then click **Update**.

Next, on the **NPM Build** tab, add the following: 
- **Entry Point:** index.js
- **Build Command:** npm run build --production
- **Artifact Path:** dist
Click **Update**. 

<base-info>
You may need to update the entry point, arguments, build command, and/or artifact path fields based on your package.json file settings. 
The above works for the standard defaults.

## Deploy! 
If everything looks good, go to the deployments section and deploy! ðŸš€
