You can get started with your new Wordpress site in a few clicks.

1. Add a VPS profile
2. Provision a server, selecting the version of PHP you want installed (7.2, 7.3, or 7.4) and the database type you want installed (MySQL 5.7/8 or MariaDB) - typically, the version of PHP you'll want to install depends on the PHP versions that any WordPress plug-ins you might want to use support.Â 
3. After your server is provisioned, create a Wordpress site
4. After the WordPress site is successfully installed, navigate to your Wordpress site's URL and complete the setup process
