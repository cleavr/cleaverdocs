[Statamic](https://statamic.com/) is a pretty cool Laravel-based CMS for creating creative-looking sites.

In this guide, weâ€™ll work through the first section of Statamicâ€™s [quick start guide](https://statamic.dev/quick-start).

## Install Statamic on local

Referring to the quick start guide, weâ€™ll install the example app using Composer in our `~/Sites` folder.

Installing Stamatic will almost certainly fail due to a memory allocation error. If you havenâ€™t already increased your 
PHP memory limit, then youâ€™ll want to do that. The following is a great guide on how you can adjust the memory_limit setting: 
[https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/how-fix-composer-memory-issue](https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/how-fix-composer-memory-issue).

Once successfully installed, you should be able to preview on your local via [http://cyberspace-place.test](http://cyberspace-place.test/). 
If you donâ€™t have Valet installed and running, no worries. Weâ€™ll mainly be pushing this to prod and then will work more from there.

Add your project to GitHub / Bitbucket / GitLab.

## Deploy with Cleavr
Let's deploy using **Flash Deploy**.

When setting up the app type, be sure to select **Laravel** and also install a **MySQL** database server.

Flash deploy, in fell-swoop, will -
- Provision a new server
- Install app dependencies
- Create new site
- Deploy the site

## Add a user
Once you deploy the site, cick on the URL and you'll see the login screen. In order to log in, you'll need to add a user.

You'll need to SSH into the server and add a new user to login with.

### In Cleavr > Server > SSH
Add your SSH key, make sure to apply to root user. Once added, copy your serverâ€™s public IP address, and then SSH into the server via your terminal.

```
ssh root@<public ip>
```

Once in your server, head over to

```
cd /home/<site name>/current
```

Next, run the commands to create a new super user per the Quick Start commands.

```
php please make:user
```

Now, head back to the Statamic dashboard and log in.

<base-alert>
If you get a 500 error after attempting to login; itâ€™s likely a cache issue. You can clear the cache by modifying the webapp > env and enabling clear cache option. Or, just redeploy. The deployment is pretty quick.

ðŸŽ‰ Thatâ€™s it! Pretty easy. 

<base-alert>
Some users with older Statamic versions experienced circular issues during deployment on the install composer step. 
If you have this issue, SSH into your machine and install version 1 by executing: <b>composer self-update --1</b>
