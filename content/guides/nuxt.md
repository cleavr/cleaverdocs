Cleavr gives extra treatment for NuxtJS so that you can easily deploy your Nuxt SSR and Static (JAMstack) applications with just a couple of clicks.

On top of that, Cleavr also automatically installs and configures PM2 to run your app and to keep it up. Further to that, 
Cleavr sets PM2 to run in cluster mode to take advantage of available cores for added site performance.  

You can add your Nuxt app either in one fell-swoop with flash-deploy or add your app to an existing server. In this guide, we'll 
add a Nuxt app to an existing server. 

## Step 1: Add a Nuxt site

On an existing server, click **Add Site** to add a new site to your server. 

You'll see a web app type option for Nuxt. Clicking on the ellipses will allow you to select between a Nuxt SSR app and a Nuxt Static app.

### Which option should you choose?

Which option you select depends on how you have your app configured in the `nuxt.config.js` file AND how you want your site to operate in production. 

SSR is the more common, as well as the default, mode of Nuxt where the server dynamically serves HTML to clients when requested. Static mode will convert your whole app to pure HTML files
at the time of generation, which happens during the deployment process. 

In your `nuxt.config.js` file, check to see if you have the following listed: 

```javascript
target: 'static'
```

If `target: 'static` is present, then you'll want to select the **Nuxt Static** option in Cleavr. Otherwise, select the **Nuxt SSR** option. 

Next, fill out the hostname you'd like to use and select any additional desired options. Then, select **Add** to add the new site to your server.

Don't worry about trying to figure out what environments need to be installed on your server. Cleavr will add any missing environment 
dependencies based on the new app type you've added.

## Step 2: Configure Web App

After the site has successfully installed, you'll now need to create a web app and deploy out your app. 

In the web app section, you'll notice that a new web app was automatically created after the Nuxt site was added. This is a basic web app shell
that you can use to complete the setup of your web app. Click on **Complete Setup** on the web app.

For more complex apps that have multi-server architecture (multiple web app servers, database servers, queue servers, etc), then you'll want to 
create a new web app so you can define which servers are part of the app's server architecture.

Configure the **VC Provider**, **Repository**, and **Branch To Deploy** fields on the Settings > Code Repository tab and then click **Update**.

From here, you may have additional configurations to make depending on how you set up your web app: 

- In Settings > NPM Build, the `npm start` script in Entry Point and Arguments will work for the majority of situations, you may need to define an entry point if you have it configured different to the standard
- If you are using GitHub for the VC Provider, consider enabling the GitHub Actions integration in the settings area so that you can use GitHub to build your app, which frees up your server's resources during deployments
- The Hooks section has default deployment hooks to deploy your SSR and Static apps. If you have additional commands to run during deployment, create a custom deployment hook and add it to the correct order placement that it should run in during deployments

## Step 3: Deploy!
If everything looks good, go to the deployments section and deploy! ðŸš€
