[Astro](https://astro.build/) is a modern, fast-growing static site building framework that takes creating websites back to the basics.

## Step 1: Build An App

Check out the [Astro Getting Started Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) and start building your app. They have several example
projects that you can use as a starting point or for testing. 

Once you have your project ready to deploy, add it to your code repository, such as GitHub. 

## Step 1: Add A NodeJS Static App 

In Cleavr, provision a server an add a new NodeJS Static application. 

When adding the site, set **Artifact Path** to `dist`. 

## Step 2: Configure App For Deployment

After the site has been added to your server, go to the web app in the Web App section, go to Settings > Code Repository tab, connect to your code repository and branch to deploy. 

## Step 3: Deploy! 

You're now all set to deploy! 

That's it! Easy.
