[Directus](https://directus.io/) is an open source app that wraps your new, or existing, SQL database with a realtime GraphQL+REST API for developers and an intuitive admin app for non-technical users. It supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, OracleDB, MariaDB, AWS Aurora and more.

Directus mirrors your custom database, with your schema and content stored pure and unaltered. When it comes time to ingest, fetch, or update your data, you can use its REST+GraphQL API, JavaScript SDK, or even pure SQL. Directus gives you plenty of access options to choose from.

## Step 1: Add New Directus Site

On a new server in your [cleavr.io account](https://cleavr.io), add a new site and select **Directus** as the app type.

Expand **Advanced Options** and enable the option to **Setup Database**. Select MySQL for your database server type.

## Step 2: Connect code repository

In the web app section, select **Complete Setup** for the web app that was created for the site.

On the **Code Repository** tab, enter the following:

**Version Control Provider**: GitHub

**Repository**: `cleavr/directus-example`

**Branch**: `master`

Click **Update**.

Make sure to use a GitHub account for this example. This is a public repository that you retrieve from and deploy on your own server.

## Step 3: Deploy!

Once you have everything configured, deploy! ðŸš€

After deployment, check the `Build Assets` logs. You will get the initial email and password to login to your Directus app.
