[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a React/JavaScript framework used for developing SSR and static websites.

[Cleavr](https://cleavr.io) deploys Next JS applications to your virtual private servers with minimal configurations required.

In this guide, we'll provide two examples for deploying Next apps. The first example will walk through deploying a standard setup and the
second example will show how to deploy using Next's Custom Server settings.

## Example 1: Standard Next App

### Add a NodeJS SSR site

On an existing server, click **Add Site** to add a new site to your server.

Make sure to select the following configuration options:

- **App Type**: NodeJS SSR
- **Entry Point**: npm
- **Arguments**: start
- **Artifact folder**: .next
- **Port Number**: 3000

Select **Add** to add the new site to your server.

#### Port Number

Next defaults to port 3000 and so you will either need to explicity configure the site to point to port 3000 as in the above step, or you can modify your code to accept a random port, `process.env.PORT`, assigned by Cleavr.

### Add a Web App

After the site has successfully installed, you'll now need to create a web app and deploy out your application.

In the web app section, you'll notice that a new web app was automatically created after the NodeJS site was created. This is a basic web app shell
that you can use to complete the setup of your web app. Click on **Complete Setup** on the web app.

Configure the **VC Provider**, **Repository**, and **Branch To Deploy** fields on the Settings > Code Repository tab and then click **Update**.

You may need to update the entry point, arguments, build command, and/or cwd path fields based on your package.json file settings.

## Deploy!

If everything looks good, go to the deployments section and deploy! ðŸš€

## Example 2: Using Custom Server

Next is built for Vercel, the maintainers of the Next.js framework. So, it's not surprising that they build Next.js with deployments over Vercel in mind.
However, they do allow customization and provide an example of [how to setup a custom server](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-server) on their docs site.

The below example deploys the [custom server example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/custom-server). Refer to the ReadMe file to
clone the example to your local and then add to your preferred code repository.

### Add a NodeJS SSR site

On an existing server, click **Add Site** to add a new site to your server.

Select the **NodeJS SSR** option and enter the remainder site details and click **Add** to create the new site on your server.

Cleavr will automatically install NodeJS on your server if NodeJS has not already been installed.

### Add a Web App

After the site has successfully installed, you'll now need to create a web app and deploy out your application.

In the web app section, you'll notice that a new web app was automatically created after the NodeJS site was created. This is a basic web app shell
that you can use to complete the setup of your web app. Click on **Complete Setup** on the web app.

Configure the **VC Provider**, **Repository**, and **Branch To Deploy** fields on the Settings > Code Repository tab and then click **Update**.

Next, on the **NPM Build** tab, add the following:

- **Entry Point:** server.js
- **Build Command:** npm run build --production
  Click **Update**.

## Deploy!

If everything looks good, go to the deployments section and deploy! ðŸš€
