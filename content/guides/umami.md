[Umami](https://umami.is/) is a simple website analytics platform that you can install on your server and take control of usage data across your web
properties.

Umami uses the Next.js framework and is easy to deploy to your server using Cleavr without deviating much from their instructions on their
[readme file on GitHub](https://github.com/mikecao/umami).

## Step 1: Add New SSR App

On a new server, add a new site, selecting **Node JS SSR** as the app type.

Once the site has been successfully added, go to the site's settings and click the **NGINX Config** tab.

Since Umami is configured to run on port 3000, we'll need to update the `proxy_pass` setting to reflect that.

Find the `proxy_pass` setting and set the port number to `3000`.

<base-info>
Note that the port number for the app when you look at the site details will continue to display as the port number Cleavr
automatically assigned. This won't impact deploying Umami. 
</base-info>

Click **Update**

## Step 2: Add A database

On the same server you added the site, click on the database section to install a new MySQL (or optionally Postgres) database.

Once the database server is installed, add a new database. Remember the database name and database user credentials.

## Step 3: Configure Deployment Workflow

In the deployment workflow section, select **Complete Setup** for the deployment workflow that was created for the site created earlier.

### Enter repository

#### Option 1 - quick and simple but with no automatic updates

On the **Code Repository** tab, enter the following:

**Version Control Provider:** GitHub

**Repository:** umami-software/umami

**Branch:** master

Click **Update**.

#### Option 2 - automatic updates

Before making the settings in the **Code Repository** tab, open antoher browser tab and login to github. Clone the repository https://github.com/umami-software/umami.

Back in cleavr.io:

On the **Code Repository** tab, enter the following:

**Version Control Provider:** Your GitHub Profile

**Repository:** \<your-github-profile-name\>/umami

**Branch:** master

turn on **Deploy on Code Push to master**

Click **Update**.

We will add a github action to automatically sync the umami-software/umami repository with your fork at the end.   
If you don't want to have the updates automated, ignore Step 5. Then you can alternatively trigger the cleavr.io deploment by syncing your fork in github manually.

<base-info>
You will need a GitHub VC provider account created for this step.
</base-info>

### Add env variables

Click on the **Environments** section and add in the following environment variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://<db username>:<db password>@localhost:3306/<db name>
HASH_SALT=<some random string of characters>
```

Replace the `<>` pieces above with the appropriate information for your database that you setup earlier as well as a random
hash salt.

Click on **Sync**.

### Create deployment hook

We'll also need to have a command ran to migrate the database tables. We'll use a deployment hook to achieve this.

Select **Hooks** and add a new hook.

**Hook Name:** migrate database

**Hook:**

```
cd {{ releasePath }}
mysql -u<db username> -p<db password> <dab name> < sql/schema.mysql.sql
```

Replace the `<>` accordingly with the database info. Take note that there is no space between `-p` and your password.

Click **Update**.

<base-info>
You can optionally choose to run the command via SSH if you wish. 
</base-info>

Place the migrate database hook directly following the build assets hook.

## Step 4: Deploy!

Once you have everything configured, deploy! ðŸš€

Select the URL for the site, and then enter the default user credentials:

**Username:** admin   
**Password:** umami

## Step 5: Optional if you went for option 2 in step 3 above
### Set up a Personal Access Token (PAT) in Github
- Go to your github profile to [Settings/Developer Settings/Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) and create a new token with the following Repositiory permissions:
  - read: Metadata
  - read and write: Contents, Workflows   
- Copy the secret!
- Go to the **Settings**-Tab in your forked umami repository
  - Click on "Secrets and variables" - Actions and add a new Repository secret by clicking on "New repository secret". Call it WORKFLOW_TOKEN and paste in the secret into the "value"-field

Head over to the **Code**-Tab in your forked umami repository. 

Go into the `.github/workflows` directory and add a new file `sync-to-fork.yml` and add the following contents: 

```
name: Sync Fork

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
  # check for updates every Sunday at 1a.m.
  - cron: "0 1 * * 0"

jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Sync and merge upstream repository with your current repository
        # using dabreadman/sync-upstream-repo from the marketplace
        # You may pin to the exact commit or the version.
        # uses: dabreadman/sync-upstream-repo@fc5fe9952946b1daaafd9abd7fcd7e260b81ddbe
        uses: dabreadman/sync-upstream-repo@v1.3.0
        with:
          # URL of gitHub public upstream repo
          upstream_repo: "https://github.com/umami-software/umami.git"
          # Branch to merge from upstream (defaults to downstream branch)
          upstream_branch: "master"
          # Branch to merge into downstream
          downstream_branch: "master"
          # GitHub Bot token
          token: ${{ secrets.WORKFLOW_TOKEN }}
```
Commit the new file. This may start a deployment on Cleavr if GitHub Actions is enabled for the branch. 

In the GitHub repo, go to the project's **Actions** tab and select the "Sync Fork" Action. Next, run the workflow.   

This action will look for updates at your scheduled time (cron). Changes to the original repo will be synced and Cleavr will run a deployment.
