[WordPlate](https://github.com/wordplate/wordplate) is a WordPress boiler plate that is a great for development-minded WordPress users.

With WordPlate, you can update WordPress locally on your device, and then deploy the finished product out using the deployment workflow deployment method in Cleavr.

Another benefit of WordPlate is that you can benefit from some of the enhancements and more modern development methods that they've introduced. Such as, you can
make use of a `.env` file to maintain environment variables, such as database connections.

## Step 1: Install WordPlate

The first step is to install WordPlate on your local device.

Follow the [WordPlate instructions on their README file to get going](https://github.com/wordplate/wordplate).

Once installed, build your WordPress site on your local environment and continue on to the following instructions when ready to deploy.

## Step 2: Commit Your Code To A Version Control Repository

Add your code to [GitHub](https://github.com/), [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/).

## Step 3: Add Server And Site

In Cleavr, provision a new server.

Once the server has completed setup, add a new **PHP** site to the server and enter `public` for the **Web Directory**.

Also, select the advance option to also create a database during site creation. Remember the database details as you'll need to add them later to the environment section.

### Step 4: Configure Deployment Workflow Code Repository

Navigate to the deployment workflow section. You'll notice that a new deployment workflow has been added after adding the site. This is the master deployment workflow that we'll configure to deploy the WordPlate site to the
server.

Click into the deployment workflow, then go to `Settings > Code Repository` and select the **VC Provider** for where your code is and then enter the **Repository** and **Branch To Deploy** info.

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables

On the **Environment** tab, add in the `.env` variables.

They should look something like the following.

```
WP_ENV=production
WP_DEBUG=false
WP_THEME=wordplate
WP_PREFIX=wp_

DB_HOST=<db public ip>
DB_NAME=<database name>
DB_USER=<database user>
DB_PASSWORD=<database password>

## Step 6: Verify deployment hooks
