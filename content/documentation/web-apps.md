## What is a web app?
In Cleavr, a web app can be a simple static HTML website or a complex, multi-server web application. Much of the web 
app area is centered around building and deploying your web app. 

When you add a site, a shell web app will automatically be created. All you need to do is configure the web app by connecting to the code
repository to be used, setup any additionally required deployment hooks, add any required environment variables, and then deploy. 

Web Apps are tied to a site, but are different in that web apps can involve multiple servers. Cleavr makes setting up and
deploying multi-server architecture apps a cinch.

For WordPress sites, you do not need to set up a web app 
as once you create the WordPress site, you are all ready to go to head over to the URL you set up and manage WordPress via its user interface.

## Adding a new web app

To add a new web app, go to the Web App section.

Click the **Add Webapp** button, provide a **Name** for the web app and select the related **Site**, and then click **Add**. 

The next thing you'll want to do now, is update the [Web App Settings](/web-app-settings).
