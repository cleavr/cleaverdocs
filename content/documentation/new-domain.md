## Adding a new domain
1. Click Add
2. Add a domain; such as: mydomain.com (only add a root domain, do not add sub-domains here)

4. Select Add
 

## Synching with an existing domain
If you already have a domain in use in your provider account, you can enter the domain using the instructions above. 
Cleavr will check to see if the domain already exists on the provider account and if it does, Cleavr will pull the existing 
DNS records into Cleavr so that you can manage them from within Cleavr.
