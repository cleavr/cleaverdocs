Webapp Log Reports show you your app logs in a beautiful, easy-to-use interface, making it easy to locate and troubleshoot issues. 

Log Reports are located in the Webapp section and is currently available for Laravel apps only. Other app types will be supported soon. 

The Log Report comes with handy filters to filter by log type, a sort option to order by newest to oldest and vice-versa, 
s well a donut chart to visualize log types. 

For Laravel apps, the Laravel app must create log files using the standard `laravel-yyyy-mm-dd.log` format.
