## What is a database?
A database can be configured on your servers. Databases hold structured data for your websites and apps and can either be 
installed on the same server as your website / app or on its own dedicated server.

## What types of databases can I add?
The following types of databases can be added to your provisioned servers.

## [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
One of the best known relational databases, MySQL is an open-source product by Oracle. You can choose between MySQL 5.7 and MySQL 8.0.

## [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
An open-source object-relational databases, PostgreSQL is built for speed and for data analytics. 

## [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/)
A fork of MySQL, MariaDB is another popular relational database.

## Install a database
During the steps to provision a new server, you have the option to install one of the database types. This will install the database system onto your server and you can then add databases after provisioning is complete.

## Add a new database
In Servers > your selected server > Databases, scroll to the Add New Database section. You can add as many databases as youâ€™d like. You can also add a username and password to your database.

## Manage databases and users
In Servers > your selected server > Databases, you have the option to remove previously created database users and databases.

## Open database hosts to outside servers
When creating a new PostgreSQL database, enter the IP for the outside server that will access the database. 

## Database Monitoring
If you have server monitoring enabled for your server, then you can also select the option to enable database monitoring from the database section. 
This will show database monitoring reports in this section. 

## What database should I use for WordPress?
MySQL 5.7, MySQL 8.0, and MariaDB 10.4 will work with your WordPress site.
