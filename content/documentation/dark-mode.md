When you log into Cleavr, you will see either the light mode or dark mode theme depending on what you enabled for your device.

If you'd like to switch modes, you will need to go to you devices general settings and change the theme.

For example, Mac users can change the appearance under System Preferences > General.

You can also toggle between light and dark mode from the Preferences section which you can get to from your Avatar menu.
