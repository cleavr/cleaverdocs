We try to keep everything a click away in Cleavr. This includes bringing in DNS record management. This makes setting up
domains for your sites zoom! 🏎

## DNS Providers

### [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)

Cloudflare is a web infrastructure and security tool that assists with many valuable services such as DNS record management, 
DDoS mitigation, SSL certificate creation and management, and much more. Cloudflare is a great service to use in conjunction 
with Cleavr if you are looking for even more layers of protection. 

In your Cloudflare account, grab your API Key from your **Profile > API Tokens > View Global API Key** 

### [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

DigitalOcean also provides some DNS record management functions. If you already have DO setup as a VPS provider, you can 
use the same **Personal Access Token** to setup the DNS records connection. 

You will need to ensure that your [domain points to DigitalOcean's nameservers](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-point-to-digitalocean-nameservers-from-common-domain-registrars).
